- some of the hand edited objects refer to hard-coded primary keys (eg GeneFeature.pm uses a sequence_type_id of 13)

- table objects should provide documentation that is stored in db (for use by schema browser)

- object classes should have pod documentation so we can make a web doc.

- make rollback segment a config property (where "null" means none)

- think about the problem that $rollback is global across all DbiDbHandles.

- correct the inserted object count in the case where there has been a rollback

- rename userName to loginName in .gus.properties

- document .gus.properties 

- write getSubclass($id, $tableName) method to get the subclass object

- don't generate Imp objects in the perl layer. Upgrade obj layer so that it doesn't need them.

- handle case where Objects need to be regenerated because generator has been updated

- factor the RelationalRow stuff out of Model/GusRow.pm.

- generate should take an option to remove all non-manually edited files first

- object constructor must pass all attr values through dedicated settors

- use initXXX method for values coming from db

- use attribute name not table name as key for all relations

- setSubclassView can be generated and include xform into proper table name syntax

- avoid name collisions between subs in GusRow, etc, and generated class. (use a convention like underscore to delineate these)

- mention in docs:  failure to insert rows due to primary key constraint violation, ie, object layer is trying to insert a row whose primary key value is already in db.   DBD::Oracle::st execute failed: ORA-00001: unique constraint
(DOTS.PK_CLONE) violated (DBD ERROR: OCIStmtExecute)

- provide an oracle independent "sysdate" function

- use Carp's confess instead die, etc


DONE

- build system is not detecting when .man files change.

- build system needs to delete old model when generating all objects.
